				<h3>PURPOSE &amp; AIM</h3>
				<p><strong>Edit Orders</strong> is an admin module that
					allows administrative users to edit a customer's order
					to change:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The customer, billing or shipping information</li>
					<li>Add, delete, and edit products in an order</li>
					<li>Update product quantities and pricing</li>
					<li>Modify product attributes</li>
					<li>Add, delete, and edit order totals</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Store Owners can specify which users are allowed to edit orders.<br />
					After following the installation instructions (and any
					additional instructions as needed), it is very strongly
					recommended that you read through the ENTIRE
					<a onclick="expandcontent('sc3', this);" href="javascript:void(0)"><strong>How to Use</strong></a>
					section. There you will find more details of the capabilities
					of Edit Orders.
				</p>
				<p><b>*** READ EVERYTHING IN THIS README BEFORE YOU BEGIN ***</b></p>
				<p>See the <a onclick="expandcontent('sc5', this);" href="javascript:void(0)"><strong>Credits &amp; History</strong></a>
					section to see a detailed list of credits and the view the
					change history of Edit Orders since the last version.
				</p>
				<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
				<div><ul>
					<li>Working installation of Zen Cart 1.5.x</li>
					<li>Secure FTP access to the Zen Cart installation (while you can use plain FTP it is not recommended)</li>
					<li>An account to access Zen Cart's administrative interface</li>
					<li>Read and agree to the <a onclick="expandcontent('sc6', this);" href="javascript:void(0)">License</a></li>
				</ul></div>
				<div class="boldemphasis">
					<p>EDIT ORDERS 4.x IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERSIONS OF
						ZEN CART PRIOR TO ZEN CART 1.5!!
					</p>
					<p>There will be no support provided for Zen Cart v1.3.x
						with v4.x of Edit Orders<br /><small>(if you are still
						running an older version of Zen Cart we strongly
						recommend that you upgrade as there are many security
						and performance enhancements in Zen Cart v1.5.1)</small>
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>KNOWN ISSUES</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Not all order total modules are fully supported. If you use a custom order_total module check with your module vendor.</li>
					<li>Zen Cart FILE_UPLOAD attributes are not supported.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>POTENTIAL FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS</h3>
				<p>This module will only get better with the help of active
					contributors. If you use this module please consider
					helping answer questions in the Zen Cart forums regarding
					this module and contributing to the development of future
					versions.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Convert the &quot;state&quot; address field to a dropdown if enabled.</li>
					<li>Add a dropdown to the addresses allowing quick selection
						of an address from the customer's stored addresses.
					</li>
					<li>Add the ability to get an updated shipping quote.</li>
					<li>Add the ability to resend order update (status history) E-Mails.</li>
					<li>Refactor relevant functions into subclasses of existing Zen Cart classes.</li>
					<li>Add integration with &quot;Stock by Attributes&quot; (for stock levels).</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Do you use any other Zen Cart modules?</h3>
				<p>We've complied a list of other Zen Cart modules known to be
					compatible with Edit Orders and any special instructions
					needed to allow them to interoperate with Edit Orders.
					Before installing please check out <a onclick="expandcontent('sc4', this);" href="javascript:void(0)"><strong>Integration with Other Modules</strong></a> section to learn more!

						<ol class="zero">
							<li><strong>Pre-Installation</strong>.<ol>
								<li>Backup your Zen Cart installation and
									database. Best practice is to keep regular
									backups and perform a manual backup prior

									<small>You can use Secure FTP to backup the
									files. Two well known FTP programs are
									WinSCP and FileZilla.<br /> 
									You can backup the MySQL database either

								Because these files are modified versions of
								core Zen Cart files and will impact your store
								and potentially other plugins, they have been
								separated from the new files added by this
								plugin for easy identification.
								<ol>
									<li>Rename the &quot;your_admin_folder&quot;
										folder to match the name of your store's
										admin folder.
									</li>
									<li>If you have installed any other plugins
										or modifications to your Zen Cart
										installation which make changes to any

				<h3 id="integration_ot">Order Total Modules</h3>
				<p>Order Total modules are used to change the total cost of an
					Order. Edit Orders uses the same Order Total modules as the
					customer checkout process. Most of the Order Total modules
					which ship with Zen Cart have been tested and work as expected
					(coupon, gift voucher, low order fee, shipping, subtotal,
					tax, and total). <span class="emphasis">Both ot_subtotal and
					ot_total must be enabled for Edit Orders to function.</span>
				</p>
				<div class="regularlist">
					<fieldset>
						<legend id="integration_onetime_discount">Onetime Discount</legend>
						<p>The &quot;Onetime Discount&quot; Order Total Module
							is fully compatible with &quot;Edit Orders&quot;.

							items&quot; folder of the &quot;Edit Orders&quot;
							distribution zip file.

						<legend id="integration_local_sales_taxes">Local Sales Taxes</legend>
						<p>(<strong>You MUST have Local Sales Tax 2.3.5 or 
							newer installed</strong>)
						</p>
						<p>You will need to follow the following steps to use
							&quot;Edit Orders&quot; with Local Sales Tax 2.3.5
							or newer.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Copy &quot;/includes/functions/extra_functions/functions_local_sales_taxes.php&quot;
								to &quot;/your_admin_folder/includes/functions/extra_functions/functions_local_sales_taxes.php&quot;.<br />
								<small>(&quot;your_admin_folder&quot; is the location
								of your Zen Cart admin folder.)</small>

						</ul>
						<p class="emphasis">
							The tax rate shown next to individual products only
							replects the Zen Cart configured tax rate. It does
							not include any tax rates defined by &quot;Local
							Sales Tax&quot;. The sales tax rate cannot be adjusted
							by Edit Orders for the Local Sales Taxes module.
						</p>
					</fieldset>
					<fieldset>
						<legend id="integration_ot_other">Other Modules (troubleshooting)</legend>
						<p>Because Edit Orders loads the same Order Total modules
							as the customer checkout process, all enabled modules
							must be able to be loaded and processed from the Zen
							Cart administrative interface. Because Zen Cart
							traditionally does not process Order Total modules
							from the administrative interface, many 3rd party
							Order Total modules were designed without the
							authors taking this into consideration.
						</p>
						<p>The most common sympton caused by a misbehaving Order
							Total module (when editing an order) will be
							encountering a &quot;blank&quot; page
							when adding	a product to (or updating) the order.
							<span class="emphasis">In most cases taking a look
							at the <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?124">error log generated by Zen Cart</a>
							will provide valuable insight in how to correct the
							problem.</span> Another option is to disable all
							Order Total modules which do not ship with Zen Cart
							and slowly enable more testing in between to
							determine which Order Total module is causing the
							blank page.
						</p>
						<div>Here are some common causes of issues with 3rd party
							Order Total modules and howto fix:<ul>
							<li>The module added functions to the catalog side of
								Zen Cart but not the Zen Cart administrative side.
								<b>FIX:</b> Copy the functions to the administrative
								side of Zen Cart. 
							</li>
							<li>The module <b>only</b> uses $_SESSION['cart']
								while processing data to determine the Order Total
								value to display. <b>FIX:</b> Update the module
								to check and use $order as a fallback. Disable
								the &quot;mock&quot; shopping cart if neccessary.

						the QA testing and helped create a better "Edit Orders"
						module! <strong>Without you and others who have
						contributed, this module would not exist or be as
						full featured.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>We would also like to thank those who have joined the

							<li>Added various changes to support Zen Cart 1.5.2 (including copying additional functions from the catalog side).</li>
							<li>Added a mock &quot;shopping cart&quot; class which reads product data from the current order. This should help with Order Total modules which only look at the shopping cart ($_SESSION['cart']) and ignore the order ($order).</li>
							<li>Added optional &quot;debug&quot; file logging. This should only be used for problem solving as it may adversely affect performance.</li>
							<li>When a product is loaded from the database, additional fields are populated to match Zen Cart 1.5.2 handling.</li>

								<ul>
									<li><strong>admin/init_includes/init_currencies.php</strong> to load the currencies class.</li>
									<li><strong>includes/classes/order_total.php</strong> to load the correct language files.</li>
									<li><strong>includes/classes/shipping.php</strong> to load the correct language files.</li>

									<li>You can now search by product id, name, description, and model.</li>
									<li>Step 2 now shows both the product name and model.</li>
									<li>The built-in Zen Cart functions are called in a similar manner as adding a product to your shopping cart. This ensures the order totals can be automatically updated.</li>
									<li>You can disable the use of "specials / sales prices" still. This is not recommended.</li>
									<li>The store settings for handling attributes (including showing / hiding) are utilized.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>When updating a product: product information is pulled from the database, then requested changes (such as name and price) are merged. This ensures the correct product information is always present in the order.</li>
							<li>Updated to utilize the order_totals class and modules
								<ul>
									<li>Order Total modules are loaded when adding or updating a product.</li>
									<li>Ensures proper calculation of subtotal and total.</li>
									<li>Tax calculation now is done automatically using the store settings (same as during a customer checkout).</li>
									<li>Order Total Lines are now added by selecting the desired module from a dropdown.</li>
									<li>The Order Total dropdown contains a list of installed order totals not already present in the order.</li>
									<li>Added support for specifying and changing the shipping module when a shipping line is used.</li>
									<li>Removed field for changing the shipping tax. This is automatically calculated by <strong>includes/modules/order_total/ot_shipping.php</strong>.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Copied (and modified for use in the admin side of Zen Cart) a handful of the catalog tax functions to <strong>admin/functions/extra_functions/edit_orders_functions.php</strong></li>
							<li>Updated the installation script to add additional failure messages and not report success if a step fails.</li>
							<li>Fixed the order status dropdown to correctly select order status. This avoids the status being accidentally changed if the status is not "Pending (1)".</li>
							<li>Moved the "edit" button in the order menu over so the "details" button is more likely to be clicked by someone quickly looking at an order. This should hopefully lower the number of "accidentally" edited orders.</li>
							<li>Added special handling to support the "ot_loworderfee" module.</li>
							<li>Added some "dummy" files for those upgrading from an older version.</li>

							<strong>v 2.0 10/15/2008 - Scott Turner</strong>
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Implemented new attributes handling in the following ways:
								<ul>
									<li>-- a) In addition to the more complicated attribute editor, a simpler option is available.
										<ul>
											<li>-- i) Select a new attribute from a drop-down menu in admin.</li>
											<li>-- ii) The new price will be automatically calculated by subtracting the old attribute price and adding the new attribute price.<br />
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>-- b) Text attributes now are implemented through a text box.</li>
									<li>-- c) Fixed attribute pricing for the following scenarios:
										<ul>
											<li>-- i) One Time Charges Implemented</li>
											<li>-- ii) Price Factor &amp; Offset Implemented</li>
											<li>-- iii) One Time Price Factor &amp; Offset Implemented</li>
											<li>-- iv) Attributes Qty Price Implemented</li>
											<li>-- v) One Time Attributes Qty Price Implemented</li>
											<li>-- vi) Price Per Word &amp; Free Words Implemented</li>
											<li>-- vii) Price Per Letter &amp; Free Letters Implemented</li>
											<li>-- viii) Specials and Sales Implemented for Attributes When Option is Selected for Attribute</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>-- d) Product one time charges are easily editable.</li>
									<li>-- e) You can switch back and forth between the old advanced attribute editor and the easier one using a text-link.
										<ul>
											<li>-- i) The advanced attribute editor allows you to change the price and attribute option and value manually.</li>
											<li>-- ii) The simple attribute editor allows you to choose from the attributes listed in your database.</li>
											<li>-- iii) The advanced attribute editor will not update prices it leaves you to do this.</li>
											<li>-- iv) The simple attribute editor updates prices automatically.</li>
											<li>-- v) The simple attribute editor is the preferred method of altering attributes! The advanced is useful for advanced purposes.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>-- f) Downloads are now implemented correctly and will change automatically when using the simple attribute editor.</li>
									<li>-- g) All attribute data from TABLE_PRODUCTS_ATTRIBUTES now moves successfully to TALBE_ORDERS_PRODUCTS_ATTRBIUTES when an attribute option is changed using the simple attribute editor.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Adding products has added a few new features.
								<ul>
									<li>-- a) You can choose whether or not new products use the special or sales price.</li>
									<li>-- b) Text attributes now work with a text box.</li>
									<li>-- c) Many new attribute options are implemented correctly when calculating the price for new products. See 1-c for more info.</li>
									<li>-- d) Downloads are now implemented correctly.</li>
									<li>-- e) All attribute data from TABLE_PRODUCTS_ATTRIBUTES now moves successfully to TALBE_ORDERS_PRODUCTS_ATTRBIUTES when a new product is added with an attribute.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Coupon and group discounts now calculate correctly with taxes. To do so, the mod uses your average tax rate for all the products that were purchased.</li>
							<li>Fixed problem with quantity discounts adding to total instead of subtracting.</li>
							<li>Changed behavior so that clicking "details" on the order screen will give you the original edit orders page that Zen Cart has built in.
								<ul>
									<li>-- a) This allows you to choose which page you want to use. Click "details" for just the basics. Click "edit" to make some changes to an order.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Fixed problems with data in TABLE_ORDERS_PRODUCTS not updating includng products_price, products_tax, and final_price.</li>
							<li>You can now enter a value for shipping taxes and this will calculate correctly. Zen Cart doesn't store this info in the database, so this must be changed every time when editing orders. A compromise, but better than nothing.</li>
							<li>Added lines for edits to orders.php per popular demand on Zen Cart forums.</li>
