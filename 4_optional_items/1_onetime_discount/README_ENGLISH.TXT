Onetime Discount (order total module)
===========================================================
This order total module provides an easy way for Zen Cart
administrative users to add onetime discounts to specific
orders.

When this module is used, an order total line will be added
in the database indicating the order was discounted and
will include the amount of the discount.

Customers will see the discount in their order history on
the Zen Cart website and Administrative users will see the
discount in the order details, when editing an order, and
in the invoice.

COMPATIBILITY

MySQL 5.1/5.5, PHP 5.3/5.4, Zen Cart 1.5

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===========================================================
0. Pre - Installation. Backup your Zen Cart installation
  and database. Best practice is to keep regular backups
  and perform a manual backup prior to the installation or
  modification of any portion of Zen Cart.

  If upgrading, log into the admin side of your Zen Cart
  installation using a web browser. Navigate to the order
  total page ("Modules" -> "Order Total"). Select this
  module from the list and click the "remove" button.

1. Copy files from "1_new_files/includes" to your Zen Cart
  installation under "/includes". If upgrading overwrite
  any existing files.
